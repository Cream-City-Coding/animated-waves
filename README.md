# animated-waves

This is an adaptation of this codepen, https://codepen.io/goodkatz/pen/LYPGxQz. It turns it into a portable, full featured, easy to use web component.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.1. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
